    <h1>ALMCSS - Parser Test</h1>
    <p>Currently the parser is very simplistic (not so the lexical analyser): it only recognised rule sets and, from those rules, only <em>display</em> and <em>position</em> properties are syntactically checked and returned in a sort of simplified CSS Object Model.</p>
    <p>However it should be able not only to read any other CSS rule, but also <em>recover</em> both for true CSS errors and for those other parts of the grammar that have not been implemented yet (for example, &ldquo;import&rdquo; rules).</p>
    <p>The HTML files in this folder try to test only that thing: the parser, to check that errors do not force infinite loops and things like that.</p>

            <p class="two">And therefore it should be parsed and painted.</p>
