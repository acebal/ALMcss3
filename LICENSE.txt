INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

    ALMcss is a Javascript browser plugin whose aim is to provide an
    experimental implementation of the CSS3 Template Layout Module
    (http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-layout/). It has been rewritten by the
	scratch in 2012 by César Acebal (University of Oviedo). A first
	version was due to María Rodríguez and Miguel García, as a part
	of the project "Extensión al estándar CSS3 que permita la adaptación
	multidispositivo de contenidos web" funded by Fundación CTIC
    (www.fundacionctic.org), directed by César Acebal as a part of his
    Ph. D. Thesis at University of Oviedo, advised by Juan M. Cueva
    (University of Oviedo) and Bert Bos (W3C).
